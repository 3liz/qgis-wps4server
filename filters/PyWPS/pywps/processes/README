This folder contains processes, which can be offerd by the server to be
executed from the client.

The processes folder needs to contain one __init__.py with __all__ list of
available processes, e.g.

__all__ = ["foo","bar"]

will make processes in files "foo.py" and "bar.py" available (suppose, they
exist in this folder).

Several examples, as well as example of __init__.py file are already in
this folder, named with "-dist" extension. To make everything work, just
run

for f in *-dist; do out="`echo $f|sed -e 's/-dist//'`"; mv $f $out; done

This folder does not have to be, where you found it, it can be stored
anywhere in your system (e.g. /usr/local/pywps/myprocesses). Than you have
to setup 'processesPath' variable in [server] section of the configuration
file (pywps.cfg).

You can also have multiple WPS servers with only one PyWPS installation, by
creating multiple process directories (e.g.  /usr/local/pywps/myprocesses,
/usr/local/pywps/customprocesses, /foo/bar/prc, ...) and exporting
PYWPS_PROCESES environment variable. 

For example, suppose, you want to have multiple urls, with differet set of
WPS processes. For each WPS server (set of processes) create separate file
in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ with following content (e.g.):

#!/bin/sh
export PYWPS_PROCESES=/usr/local/myprocesses
/usr/bin/wps.py
# end of file

you can call the file e.g. (/usr/lib/cgi-bin/mywps

another file (/usr/lib/cgi-bin/foowps) should look like this

#!/bin/sh
export PYWPS_PROCESES=/foo/bar/prc/
/usr/bin/wps.py
# end of file

and so on
