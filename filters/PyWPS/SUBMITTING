Dear (new) PyWPS Developer,

When submitting Python code to PyWPS SVN repository, please take
care of following rules:

1. Look in the User documentation [http://wald.intevation.org/docman/view.php/22/71/install.pdf], so that you know, how PyWPS is working with custom processes.

2.  Add a header section to each file you submit and make sure you include
    the copyright. The purpose section is meant to contain a general
    overview of the code in the file to assist other programmers that will
    need to make changes to your code.

    Example (ficticious header for a file called color.c) :

# Author:	Your Name
#        	http://your.site
# Lince: 
# 
# Your Process Description
# Copyright (C) 2006 Your Name
# 
# This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
# it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

# (at your option) any later version.
# 
# This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
# but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
# MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
# GNU General Public License for more details.
# 
# You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
# along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

    The copyright protects your rights according to GNU General Public
    License (www.gnu.org).

3.  If your process is using some GRASS location, please set the
    self.grassLocation to "/var/www/wps/spearfish60/"

4.  Do not fear to use "if" condition for os.system calls, so you can
    check, if some external program failed or no:

    def execute(self):
        ...
        if os.system("g.copy rast1,rast2"):
            return "Failed to copy raster maps"

5.  For lucidity purposes, you can use self.DataInputs['identifier'] and
    self.DataOutputs['identifier'] rather then self.Inputs[0]['value']

6.  In PyWPS SVN repository, only representation processes should be
    stored. All other processes should go to PyWPS Addons, which is located
    at PyWPS Wiki [http://pywps.ominiverdi.org/wiki]
